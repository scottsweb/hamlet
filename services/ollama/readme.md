[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is the easiest way to automate your work using open models, while keeping your data safe.

For my server it is being tested with Home Assistant, supplying models to a [Home Assistant Voice](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice-pe/) assistant. I also hope to use some models with [PhotoPrism](https://www.photoprism.app/) to help classify images.

## .env

Some [settings](https://docs.ollama.com/faq) can be configured, but haven't yet needed to.
